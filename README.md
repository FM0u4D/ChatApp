## Abstract

This class project consists of designing and developing an application
web chat which will allow our client to communicate online in an effective way.
I am a young engineering student who has chosen to carry out this class project.
The main objective is to create a functional and user-friendly chat web application that will meet the
needs of our client. To do this, we have developed specifications
detailed that describes the features and requirements of the chat application.
In this project I will work closely with the client to ensure that all requirements and
the desired features are correctly implemented.

The project will be divided into several stages, from initial design to deployment
final (but We will ignore the deployment here). I started by developing a model for the web application
chat, with an emphasis on ergonomics and user-friendliness. Then I developed
the application using the latest web technologies, such
as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and frameworks like bootstrap 5, taking
to the advantage of libraries like jquery. I also tested
the application to ensure that it is fully functional and without
bugs. However, any bugs found will be patched immediately.

In summary, I am always enthusiastic about taking on this exciting challenge and for others that come,
and create a successful and efficient chat web application for our client.
I am convinced that this experience and this expertise in matters of
web development allowed me to provide a chat web application
superior quality which will meet our customer's needs.
Let's not forget that the application is a simple prototype of a web chat application to properly conceptualize another which follows the MVC pattern [Models - Views - Controllers].
We will continue to improve and update our app to meet the changing needs of our user base and to provide an ever more enriching messaging experience.
